# SMPS_5G2_FRWK
Version 5 SMPS Firmware Framework Project Template

The SMPS Firmware Framework consists of a real time operating system (RTOS) with task manager and generic task scheduler, integrated timing control and code profiling and extended code execution and system health diagnostics and fault handling. The RTOS includes an application layer (APL) for various, dependent or independent user tasks, hardware abstraction (HAL) and microcontroller abstraction layers (MCAL). The MCAL is covered by a compehensive peripheral and CPU library project supporting dsPIC33FJ, dsPIC33EP, dsPIC33CK and dsPIC33CH families of devices.
